//: ***** CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS *****

//: THIS IS MY SWIFT PLAYGROUNDS SUBMISSION FOR WWDC 2018. IN THIS PLAYGROUNDS I HAVE EXPLAINED AND IMPLEMENTED 4 CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS. I HAVE THESE ALGORITHMS IN OPERATING SYSTEMS SUBJECT. TO MAKE MY CLASS UNDERSTAND BETTER ABOUT THE ALGORITHMS AND THEIR IMPLEMNETATION I HAVE DEVELOPED THIS PLAYGROUNDS, HELPING THEM CLEARING THEIR CONCEPTS BETTER.

 //     **** Introduction To CPU Scheduling ****
 //
 //     CPU Process Scheduling is a operation which allows one process to use the CPU while
 //     the execution of another process is in waiting state due to unavailability
 //     of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU.
 //
 //     The aim of CPU schdeuling:
 //         --> Maximize CPU Utilization
 //         --> Minimize the Response Time
 //         --> Maximize the Throughput
 //         --> Maximize the Processor Efficiency
 //         --> Fair Allocation of Processes
 //         --> Minimum Turn Around Time
 //         --> Minimum Waiting Time
 //
 //     A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time. In a uniprogramming
 //     system like MS-DOS, time spent waiting for I/O is wasted and CPU is free
 //     during this time. In multiprogramming systems, one process can use CPU while
 //     another is waiting for I/O. This is possible only with process scheduling.
 //
 //     Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating
 //     systems. Such operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded
 //     into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU
 //      using time multiplexing.
 //
 //     There are different Scheduling Alorithms which a CPU follows:
 //         --> First Come First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling Algorithm
 //         --> Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm
 //         --> Round Robin (RR) Scheduling Algorithm
 //         --> Priority Scheduling Algorithm
 //
 //     Let us understand each one through Algorithm and implement them one by one..
