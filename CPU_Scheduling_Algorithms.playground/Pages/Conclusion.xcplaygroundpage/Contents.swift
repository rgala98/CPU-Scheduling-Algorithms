 //     **** Conclusion ****
 
 //     Some Facts discovered:
 //         --> FCFS can cause long waiting times, especially when the first
 //             job takes too much CPU time (Convoy Effect).
 //         --> SJF may cause starvation. Consider a situation when a long process
 //             is ready to execute and shorter processes keep coming.
 //         --> If time quantum for Round Robin scheduling is very large, then it
 //             acts same as FCFS Scheduling.
 //         --> SJF is optimal in terms of average waiting time for a given set of
 //             processes, i.e. average waiting time is minimum with this scheduling,
 //             but problems is, how to predict time of next job.
